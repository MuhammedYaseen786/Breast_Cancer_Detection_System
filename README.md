# Breast Cancer Detective System

**Objective**

To provide a standard predictive system for awareness of Breast Cancer for this reason, this system will encapsulate medical reports and gives solution that the particular person is affected by cancer or not in cancerous disease with effective decision tools by categorizing it into logistic regression analysis through training and testing subsets in appropriate manner.


**Dataset**

I got the Breast Cancer Health Diagnostic dataset to invoke the predictive system which trains the data and invent a peculiar one for new input medical records,
	Raw Data,

**Data Acknowledgement**

*  In this data, every column represents numerical terms but only one column(diagnosis) textual term.
*  Textual term contains Malignant or Benign (M or B) that is, Affected by cancer or not cancerous.
*  Accordingly, we can train this textual term (diagnosis column) corresponding to every similar column in numerical terms such as radius mean, texture mean, perimeter mean, area mean, smoothness mean, etc.
*  Hence, this leads to create logistic regression which is used for predictive modelling.
